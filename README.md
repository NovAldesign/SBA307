* When I tried to put my web pages in the pages folder and link them to the navigation bar from the folder, it would make my navagation bar css disappear.

Description of website: This is a fitness tracker challenge website. People can sign up and and participate in challenges. 

Built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- BootStrap

Reflection:
A. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
- I would have completed a full wireframe of the site. I tend to build the first page and then go from their. I tend to find more creativity in how I want things to look once I start working on html.

B. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
- I had a hard time figuring out why my pages wouldn't scroll. I had to look at each div/container to determine the sizing and figure out what was going wrong. I feel like working on the CSS for each section piece by piece will be helpful in making sure the sizing for everything is correct. 

C. What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?
- I would add more content on each page. May setup a login button at the top of each page for people to login into their account. 

D. Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
- Focus on what section at a time. Don't overwhelm yourself with trying to work on mutiple parts of the website at one time. Continue to commit, errors will occur and you want to make sure you can go back to the original change if need be.
